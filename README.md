# school-prods
This is a repo of all my school projects, for these projects the main programming languages were Java and Python

> ⚠️ Disclaimer:
Some of the code in this project was part of coursework or tutorials and is not originally authored by me.  
Where applicable, I’ve added comments in the code files to indicate the original author or source.

# Assignments
- Each assignment is a step taken into better understanding the different modules I have done
- CSC1015F focused more on introducing me to prgramming and solving problems.
- CSC1016S focused more on familiarizing me with OOP principles.
- A noteworthy asssingment is definitely Assignment 8 for CSC1016S where we built an interface using GUI.

# Future Plans
- I plan on including the first semester projects which focused more on data structures and databases.
